# Challenge #1 - Pomodoro-timer

## Brief

In this project, we're creating a Pomodoro timer.

<img src="./assets/temporizador1.gif" align="center" style="width: 70%" />

## Users should be able to:
 - Start the timer by clicking on the start link/button.
 - Once the user clicks start, the word start will change to stop. Then, the user can click on the stop button to make the timer stop.
 - Click on the gear icon to change the length (minutes and seconds) of the timer.
 - Once the timer finishes, the ring should change from green to red and an alert message is passed to the browser.
